ChromaFlux is a desktop tool designed to make editing Color and ColorOverLife

modules inside Unreal Engine .uasset files fast, visual and painless.

The project is still evolving,
so if you encounter any issues or have ideas to improve it, feel free to share.

## 🎯 Uses of the app

ChromaFlux can be used in many different ways depending on your workflow.

### Some examples:

- Quickly adjust particle colors without opening Unreal Editor
- Batch-edit MIN / MAX ColorOverLife values
- Fine-tune VFX colors for mods or prototypes
- Experiment visually with color variations
- Speed up iteration when working with large asset packs

The app is designed to save time and reduce friction when working with
ColorOverLife and Color modules, especially for modders and technical artists.```

## ⚠ Notes & Warnings

- This tool modifies `.uasset` files — **always keep backups**
- 
- If Windows flags the app or executable, it is a false positive caused by:
  - Python-based executables
  - Custom UI frameworks (Qt / PySide)
- The project is **virus-free**, but use it at your own discretion

> My goal is not to harm anyone, only to contribute a useful tool that makes
working with Unreal assets easier and faster.
